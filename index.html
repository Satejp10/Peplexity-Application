  <!-- 400-WORD ANSWER -->

    <h2>The Complete Picture (400 Words)</h2>
    <div class="answer-card">
      <div class="answer-text">
        <p>Great design lives or dies on trust — I bridge pixels and people by treating every cross-functional relationship as a design problem. As COO at an early-stage AI startup (FairQuanta), I've taken products from idea to implementation with researchers, backend engineers, and designers, shipping fast under real constraints.</p>

        <p>Exceptional talent / unconventional path: a B.Tech in CS plus a Tech MBA lets me translate between code, UX, and business. I've shipped branding ('Equivault'), trust-first UX improvements, and introduced automated AI security reviews that the team tested the same day and began implementing toward pipeline gates.</p>

        <p>Self-starter & tinkerer: I create lanes when they don't exist — building onboarding systems, writing 'For Dummies' briefs that turn dense papers into next-step plans, and prototyping RAG/user-need extraction to align product bets.</p>

        <p>AI power user: GPT-4, Claude, and Perplexity are my daily collaborators. I use them to compress research, sketch product flows, pressure-test tradeoffs, and keep the team aligned via a weekly AI/security newsletter.</p>

        <p>Writer & communicator: I optimize for clarity. Specs, UX copy, investor decks — I remove ambiguity so engineers can move, designers can decide, and stakeholders stay unblocked.</p>

        <p>Technical fluency with engineers: I discuss architecture, data contracts, latency, and complexity vs. value confidently. I not only hold my own with top engineers — I keep learning fast and bring others with me, using tools like my custom 'Tech for Dummies' GPT to turn complexity into shared momentum.</p>

        <p>Team player, humble leader: No task is beneath me if it moves the product forward. I lead through service and psychological safety, not ego.</p>

        <p>Why Perplexity: Your mission to make knowledge discovery faster and more trustworthy matches how I already operate — rapid learning, deep technical empathy, and a bias to ship. I'm ready to build products millions love, under cofounder mentorship, at Perplexity speed.</p>
